## Dockerizing Springboot Elasticsearch application with docker compose

So all this started when I decided to create an application that suggests food recipes based on the ingredients you have at your home. 

This is the tech stack that I want to use:
* Spring Boot for a RESTful API Server
* React Native with Expo for frontend and
* Elastic Search for full text search queries on the recipes. 

I have already found a dataset of around 7k recipes 
Now, this application is not meant to be an application for the general public. Its meant to be run on my private server in a private network for some limited number of people.

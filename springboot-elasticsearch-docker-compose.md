## Dockerizing Springboot Elasticsearch application with docker compose

So all this started when I decided to create an application that suggests food recipes based on the ingredients you have at your home. 

This is the tech stack that I want to use:
* Spring Boot API Server
* React Native with expo for frontend and
* 

Now, this application is not meant to be an application for the general public. Its meant to be run on my private server in a private network for some limited number of people.
